# HanamiId

Authentication solution for [Hanami](https://github.com/hanami/hanami) framework. Based on [Warden](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden) and [Bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby).

HanamiId tries to be a plug-n-play solution like Devise is for Rails. But 
instead of magic intervention, it generates a separate app with controllers, views, templates full of working code that you can easily change to your liking.  
HanamiId doesn't monkey patch anything, doesn't mess with your app configuration 
and acts completely isolated.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "hanami_id"

group :plugins do
  gem "hanami_id-generators"
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Run generator:

    $ hanami g auth --app auth --model user


Use `--help` to see all available options and defaults. They are:

- --modules
- --id_type
- --login_column
- --password_column

The above command is using Hanami CLI under the hood and will generate an 
application with all controller actions, entity, repository and all relevant 
specs (RSpec).

## Usage

For project-wide usage add Warden Rack middleware to your project:
```ruby
# config/environment.rb
Hanami.configure do
  # ...
  use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: "replace this with some secret key"
  include HanamiId::Warden::AppHelper
end
```

For usage in a specific app add Warden Rack middleware to that particular app:
```ruby
# apps/web/application.rb
module Web
  class Application < Hanami::Application
    configure do
      # ...
      sessions :cookie, secret: ENV["WEB_SESSIONS_SECRET"]
      include HanamiId::Warden::AppHelper
    end
  end
end
```

Use `authenticate_<model>!` method to fail if authentications fails and `authenticate_<model>` (without bang) to continue if authentication fails.

For example:
```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/show.rb
module Web
  module Controllers
    module Dashboard
      class Show
        before :authenticate_user!

        def call(params)
          # ...
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
